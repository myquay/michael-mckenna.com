## About 

I'm passionate about creating robust, long-lived software that's a joy to use. I enjoy thinking about and writing software. Outside of all the [dark matter development](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99), you can [find my open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/myquay?tab=repositories).
