# About this site

This is a static site consisting of just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It's generated using a software solution called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on Azure Blob Storage behind CloudFlare. There are no frameworks, all the HTML/ CSS are custom written to be as small as possible. [Websites are getting huge](https://danluu.com/web-bloat/) and it was important to me to make this site as accessable as possible no matter the data connection of the reader.

[Both this website](https://github.com/myquay/michaelmckenna.com), and [the theme used](https://github.com/myquay/hugo-theme-peripheral) are open source. Please consider contributing if you come across any errors, omissions, or improvements.
