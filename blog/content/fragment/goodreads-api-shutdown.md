slug: /goodreads-api-shutdown

I wanted to display a list of books I'd read which I keep track of in Goodreads. Unfortunately the custodians of my literary history have decided to prevent all new API access in their quest to improve data control.

> As part of our overall commitment to continually improve our data management, Goodreads no longer issues new developer keys for our public developer API and plans to retire the current version of these tools. While we assess the value of APIs to determine how > to support in the future, we continue to support active API users who meet our terms of service.

Better export my data before I lose access to it completely. While it's easy to use a thrid party service such as Goodreads; it pays to have a backup plan just incase you lose access to data locked away in a walled garden.
