The ultimate test to be sure you understand a concept is to try and teach it to someone. The way to understand a concept enough to teach it to someone is to implement it. 

I didn't exactly just sit down one afternoon and decide to write a [few blog posts](https://michael-mckenna.com/tag/guid/) about GUIDs because I know everything about them. It actually all started with a few weeks earlier wanting to understand the mechanics behind the identifier.

First I did a [bit of a Google](https://www.google.co.nz/?q=how+are+guids+generated) - good luck jumping right into the spec! Then once I had a high-level understanding [I read the spec](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt). Then to make it all stick [I implemented the spec](https://github.com/myquay/guidone). Then wrapped it all up in a little website, [guid.one](http://guid.one/) - you know, just for fun.

There's nothing groundbreaking here but hopefully it's in a format that's easy to understand so you know what's going on with those little Ã¼ber uniquer identifiers!
