## Introduction

Since writing our [multi-tenancy mini-series](/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-core-application-tenant-resolution) based on .NET Core 2.2, [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/) has come along and [is a long term supported (LTS) release](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core). This post covers off all the changes you need to complete to make our mini-series compatible with your shiny new .NET Core 3.1 web application.

## Fix for custom service provider

The custom service provider is used to support tenant specific containers as descripted [in Part 2 of the mini-series](/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-core-application-tenant-containers).

ASP.NET Core 3 has removed the ability to return a service provider from the **ConfigureServices** method, if you upgrade a project to ASP.NET Core 3 then our solution will give you a nice not supported exception on start up

```
System.NotSupportedException: 'ConfigureServices returning an System.IServiceProvider isn't supported.'
```

Which is due to how we [configure tenant specific containers](/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-core-application-tenant-containers) - we return a custom service provider.

```csharp

 return services.UseMultiTenantServiceProvider<Tenant>((t, c) =>
    {
        c.RegisterInstance(new TenantSpecificInstance()).SingleInstance();
    });

```

### Why do we use a custom service provider?

We needed to support a custom lifetime management policy for a tenant specific singleton. Since the default ASP.NET service provider does not support custom lifetime management we switched to one that does, we chose [Autofac](https://autofac.org/). Custom lifetime management policies are still unsupported in ASP.NET Core 3 so we still need to register our custom service provider and will need to use a different integration point. 

_There's a good reason the default service container doesn't support it - the vast majority of apps do not need it!_ ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‘Œ

### The new integration point

In ASP.NET Core 3+ _(and [Generic hosts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.0))_ there is a new method called **UseServiceProviderFactory** which you use to register your custom service provider factory during host configuration.

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                 ...
                .UseServiceProviderFactory(...)
```

Going back to our **UseMultiTenantServiceProvider** extension, it preformed two tasks

1. Register tenant specifc services
2. Return the new service provider

So our factory will need to also need to perform those tasks. We will call our service factory **MultiTenantServiceProviderFactory** and it will accept one argument, the callback to configure all of the multitenant services _(we don't want to configure them in the Host Configuration!)_.

Once we're done the new way to enable tenant specific containers will be like this

```csharp

public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                ...
                .UseServiceProviderFactory(
                    new MultiTenantServiceProviderFactory(Startup.ConfigureMultiTenatServices))
```

## The implementation

Our implementation has two parts

1. Our service provider factory to inject our multi-tenant container
2. The configuration callback which registers the tenant specific serivices.

### MultiTenantServiceProviderFactory

The factory will do exactly what our extension method used to do, construct a new **MultiTenantContainer** and specifty the tenant specific services configuration

```csharp

public class MultiTenantServiceProviderFactory<T> : IServiceProviderFactory<ContainerBuilder> where T : Tenant
{

    public Action<T, ContainerBuilder> _tenantSerivcesConfiguration;

    public MultiTenantServiceProviderFactory(Action<T, ContainerBuilder> tenantSerivcesConfiguration)
    {
        _tenantSerivcesConfiguration = tenantSerivcesConfiguration;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Create a builder populated with global services
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="services"></param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public ContainerBuilder CreateBuilder(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        var builder = new ContainerBuilder();

        builder.Populate(services);

        return builder;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Create our serivce provider
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="containerBuilder"></param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public IServiceProvider CreateServiceProvider(ContainerBuilder containerBuilder)
    {
        MultiTenantContainer<T> container = null;
        
        Func<MultiTenantContainer<T>> containerAccessor = () =>
        {
            return container;
        };

        containerBuilder
            .RegisterInstance(containerAccessor)
            .SingleInstance();

        container = new MultiTenantContainer<T>(containerBuilder.Build(), _tenantSerivcesConfiguration);

        return new AutofacServiceProvider(containerAccessor());
    }
}

```


### Startup.ConfigureMultiTenatServices

We still need to provide our tenant specifc service registrations, we will do this with a callback as we don't want to set these up in the host file. For our callback we've followed the framework's `ConfigureServices` idiom and placed the tenanted version in the Startup file with a very similar name `ConfigureMultiTenantServices`. This provides a nice intuitive developer experience. Global services go in `ConfigureServices` and tenant specifc services of in `ConfigureMultiTenantServices`.


```csharp

public static void ConfigureMultiTenantServices(Tenant t, ContainerBuilder c)
{
    c.Register...
}

```

Since we no longer register or service provider in the `ConfigureServices` method, we can remove our old extension method `UseMultiTenantServiceProvider` and delete it from the `ConfigureSerivces` method.

## Fix for Tenant specific options

I couldn't track down exactly why, but it seems the framework now seems to agressively resolves any **IOptions**, sometimes even before the **HttpContext** is available. We potentially need the **HttpContext** depending on our tenant resolution strategy which was causing issues with our [Tenant Specific Options](/multi-tenant-asp-dot-net-core-application-tenant-specific-configuration-options) implementation. 

To resolve this we just shunted our registration down to the tenant container where we know our tenants are resolving correctly.

### Implementation

To do this we will create a new Extension method to register our `IOptions` implementation against the container builder

```csharp

 /// <summary>
/// Register tenant specific options
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="TOptions">Type of options we are apply configuration to</typeparam>
/// <param name="tenantOptionsConfiguration">Action to configure options for a tenant</param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static ContainerBuilder RegisterTenantOptions<TOptions, T>(this ContainerBuilder builder, Action<TOptions, T> tenantConfig) where TOptions : class, new() where T : Tenant
{
    builder.RegisterType<TenantOptionsCache<TOptions, T>>()
        .As<IOptionsMonitorCache<TOptions>>()
        .SingleInstance();

    builder.RegisterType<TenantOptionsFactory<TOptions, T>>()
        .As<IOptionsFactory<TOptions>>()
        .WithParameter(new TypedParameter(typeof(Action<TOptions, T>), tenantConfig))
        .SingleInstance();


    builder.RegisterType<TenantOptions<TOptions>>()
        .As<IOptionsSnapshot<TOptions>>()
        .SingleInstance();

    builder.RegisterType<TenantOptions<TOptions>>()
        .As<IOptions<TOptions>>()
        .SingleInstance();

    return builder;
}

```

And remove our old `WithPerTenantOptions` extension. Now the options can be registered in our Per-Tenant configuration section instead of the global services section.

```csharp
c.RegisterTenantOptions<CookiePolicyOptions, Tenant>((options, tenant) =>
             {
                 options.ConsentCookie.Name = tenant.Id + "-consent";
                 options.CheckConsentNeeded = context => false;
             })
```

It makes sense to register tenant specific options in the per-tenant configuration section.

## Wrapping up

I'm very excited about all the new features in .NET Core 3, especially C# 8.0 and the introduction of [Nullable Reference Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references), I'm glad to see the [migration path from .NET Core 2.2 to 3.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=visual-studio) for quite a complicated bit of middleware was fairly straight forward here. Frameworks naturally evolve and it's nice to have a smooth upgrade experience in this case.
