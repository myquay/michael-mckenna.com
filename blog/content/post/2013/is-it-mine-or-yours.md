When designing the interface for your application the exact wording often comes later in the process, once you have some wire frames complete and a basic app up and running. But what then? What is the wording you should use when referring to items that belong to your user.

Invariably we'll need to refer to something that belongs to the user such as their profile, or their preferences; should we use the word *My* or *Your* in these instances? I've seen both used through out the internet. Is one better, is one right, is one more popular?

It seems to vary over the internet, at time of writing Twitter refers to the user's profile as *My Profile* and Google refers to what could be the user's Google+ account if they were signed in as *+You*. Further more, some services such as LinkedIn omit ownership altogether.

### What's the difference?

I think the [Dustin Curtis](https://dcurt.is/ "Dustin Curtis") nailed it with his [blog post "Yours vs. Mine"](https://dcurt.is/yours-vs-mine "Yours vs. Mine | Dustin Curtis") where he goes on to explain that the use of *Your* indicates that the interface is communicating with user whereas the use of *My* indicates that the interface is an extension of the user.

>After thinking about this stuff for a very long time, I've settled pretty firmly in the camp of thinking that interfaces should mimic social creatures, that they should have personalities, and that I should be communicating with the interface rather than the interface being an extension of myself. Tools have almost always been physical objects that are manipulated tactually. Interfaces are much more abstract, and much more intelligent; they far more closely resemble social interactions than physical tools.

>The answer for me, then, is that you're having a conversation with the interface. It's “Your stuff.”

This alone will puts me firmly in the *Your* camp but there is another reason. 

The interface is always communicating with the user. For example, with error messages like *Sorry you didn't specify an email address, how are we going to contact you?*, the interface is communicating what went wrong to the user. 

Why switch contexts and become an extension of the user just because we're talking about the user's stuff?

I believe consistency is key here.

### You have more than two options

So I'm going to use *Your* over *My* where it makes sense, but sometimes there's only one choice for the user so you might not event need to mention it.
