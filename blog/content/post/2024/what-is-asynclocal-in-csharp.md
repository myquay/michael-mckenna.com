title: What is AsyncLocal<T> in C#?
summary: Can you believe it, just like that it's been 4 and a half years since I wrote my initial series on multi-tenancy in ASP.NET and now .NET Core 8 is out. In this post I revisit multi-tenancy in ASP.NET Core and take a fresh look at how I'd implement multi-tenancy today.
