This chapter outlines the importance of documentation and the core concepts that need to be documented.

One interesting comment was the effect of Conway's Law on the design system.

To have a flexible system design, one must also be flexible with the organisation's communication structures.

The chapter also mentions the need to document the space allocation, this is not so important now as space is cheap and readily available now. However infrastructure documentation (e.g. on-prem/ clould hosted, services and dependenices, network topology etc.) fits nicely into this space.
