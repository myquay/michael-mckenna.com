title: 'TMMM: Passing the Word'
summary: 'Chapter 6, not only is a formal definition an implementation, an implementation can serve as a formal definition'
slug: /tmmm-passing-the-word

The chapter tackles the problem of communicating the architecture of large projects, not only disseminating the information but also different techniques to keep everyone on the same page.

One issue discussed is what to do when the definition and the implementation don't match - usually the implementation wins in that case as it's easier to update a manual then the program. One proposed to ensure consistency is multiple implementations, the author suggests at least two will result in a cleaner definition but this is not always possible given resource constraints.

Communication is a persistent problem in a large group effort of any purpose and although some recommendations such as the telephone log are superseeded by the rise of instant messaging the core ideas are intersting in their own right.
